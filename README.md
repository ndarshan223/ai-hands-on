# Become an AI Researcher

This repository provides a structured, hands-on path to becoming an AI researcher. It includes Jupyter notebooks covering the mathematical foundations, PyTorch fundamentals, and building neural networks from first principles.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Math Fundamentals (`1_math/`)
- Math functions, derivatives, vectors, and gradients
- Matrix operations and linear algebra
- Probability and statistics

### 2. PyTorch Basics (`2_pytorch/`)
- Creating and manipulating tensors
- Matrix multiplication, transposing, and reshaping
- Indexing, slicing, and concatenating tensors
- Special tensor creation functions

### 3. Neural Networks (`3_neural_networks/`)
- Building neurons, layers, and networks from scratch
- Normalization techniques (RMSNorm)
- Activation functions
- Optimizers (Adam, Muon) and learning rate decay

### 4. Transformers (`4_transformers/`)
- Attention and self-attention mechanisms
- Multi-head attention
- Decoder-only transformer architecture

## Learning Path

For a recommended step-by-step progression through the materials, see the Learning Path:

- `0_intro/learning_path.md`

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in order, starting with `1_math/` and progressing through `2_pytorch/` to `3_neural_networks/`.
