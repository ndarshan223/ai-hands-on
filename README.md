# Become an AI Master

A complete, hands-on to becoming a good AI Engineer.

This repository is designed to help you learn AI from first principles, build real neural networks, and understand modern LLM systems end-to-end.
You'll progress through math, PyTorch, deep learning, transformers, RAG, and OCR — with clean, intuitive Jupyter notebooks guiding you at every step.

Whether you're a beginner or an engineer levelling up, this repo gives you the clarity, structure, and intuition needed to build real AI systems.

#### ⭐ Star This Repo, If you learned something new, a star would be truly appreciated.

## Books

As someone who loves to read books, I have found the following books to be the best for learning AI. Some books PDF are added some are not added. Will add once I get the PDFs.

- `SQL Cookbook` by Anthony Molinaro
- `AI Engineering` by Chip Huyen
- `Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow` by Aurélien Géron
- `Machine Learning With Python Cookbook` by Max Kuznetsov
- `Deep Learning` by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
- `Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning` by Christopher Bishop
- `Neural Networks and Deep Learning` by Michael Nielsen
- `The Elements of Statistical Learning` by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman
- `Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning` by Christopher Bishop

## Learning Path

For a recommended step-by-step progression through the materials, see the Learning Path:

- `Start_here/learning_path.md`

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Recommended workflow:

1. Open Jupyter in the project root:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Work through notebooks in order:
   - `1.Math/`
   - `2.PyTorch/`
   - `3.Neural-Networks/`
   - `4.Transformer/`

3. Folder to run separately:
   - `5.RAG/`
   - `6.OCR/`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please ensure:

- Notebooks are clean (Restart & Run All before committing)
- Existing structure & naming conventions are followed
- PRs are focused, readable, and documented
- In folders like RAG and OCR, please maintain the cleaned structure part
- If you want to add something new folders, make it proper structure way.
